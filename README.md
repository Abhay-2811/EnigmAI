# EnigmAI: The All-in-One Art, AI, and EAI Token Ecosystem

## Addressing a Critical Issue

Many AI art models are trained on massive datasets of artwork, often without proper compensation for the artists whose creations are used. EnigmAI tackles this head-on by creating a fair and transparent system.

## The EnigmAI Advantage

- **IPFS Storage:** Ensures the secure and permanent storage of artistic contributions.
- **Tableland Database:** Provides a robust and scalable solution for managing information and state within the platform.
- **$EAI Token Utility:** Drives the entire EnigmAI ecosystem.
- **Artists Earn:** Get rewarded for their contributions used to train AI models.
- **Developers Earn:** Benefit from a thriving marketplace for their AI creations.
- **End Users:** Purchase prompt credits with $EAI to interact with AI models and generate unique artwork.
- **Decentralised Compute: [In work]** Using bacalhau + docker jobs to deploy, containerise and compute over contributed data.

## The $EAI Cycle

1. **User Purchases:** End users acquire $EAI tokens to buy prompt credits for generating AI art.
2. **Artist & Developer Compensation:** A portion of the $EAI spent goes towards rewarding artists and developers.
3. **Sustainable Ecosystem:** This continuous cycle ensures all participants are fairly compensated, fostering a healthy and vibrant art-AI community.
